# Automatic-Door-Lock-Unlock-System
Developing a system to ensure secure and controlled access to a door using Bluetooth technology.
The Door Locking System project presents an advanced solution for access control by utilizing Arduino and a Bluetooth module, seamlessly integrated with a mobile application developed in Android Studio. This innovative approach addresses the increasing demand for secure and convenient door lock and unlock operations from close proximity via a smartphone. By combining these technologies, the project aims to transform traditional lock and key mechanisms, offering a contemporary and adaptable method for managing door access. The primary objective is to develop a state-of-the-art system that allows users to control door access remotely, ensuring enhanced security, efficiency, and user-friendliness.

A key focus of this project is the implementation of robust authentication mechanisms to enhance security. By incorporating authentication protocols within the mobile app, the system ensures that only authorized users can gain access, thereby preventing unauthorized entry. This project not only improves security measures but also provides users with the flexibility and convenience to manage access control effortlessly through their mobile devices, thereby revolutionizing conventional access control systems.
